Discovering my otherness & my discomfort with the inherit nature of blogs, I was thrilled to one day discover the concept of Digital Gardens. At that time I went down a rabbit hole, jumping from one page to the next with the starting point being [Maggie Appleton's 'A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)'. It's basically a little corner for you to carve out for yourself on the internet, sharing your personal knowledge in whatever depth that you wish on topics that interest you â€“ always with the possibilty to grow, cultivate & collaborate.

Digital Garden Pattern Language:

- topography over timeline
- continuous growth
- imperfection & learning in public

This concept appealed to me so very much, that I couldn't forget about it in all these months. So here we are.

Be prepared for an eclectic mix of technical content around web development & a11y, personal discoveries about my neurodiversity, and random irl & digital craft & diy projects. ðŸŒ±

It's gonna be fun! ðŸ¤“
