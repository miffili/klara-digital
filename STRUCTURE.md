## Home

tbd, but yeah.. 😅 stuff that is usually on intro pages

## Past & Unfinished Projects

honestly, I just wanna share all the things I started & did & am proud of – highly likely nonsense stuff, but also normalize starting projects for the fun of it without pursuing it indefinitely or monetize it – my potpourri of creative endeavours

## Digital Garden

all the posts that i wanna write, my digital journal of sorts

## Road to A11y Avocado

place to learn in the open. my next step in my career. as a specialisation or a focus area ♥️

## Sharing is Caring

a list of cool people i wanna shoutout on the internet for various reasons, people that inspire me, or resources that are just worth sharing

## About

yup, same as home 😅

## Legal

because it's required 🙃
